## Developer Setup Guide

To help new developers get up and running quickly with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Redis 6+ installed locally or accessible via URL
- Supabase account (for development)
- Git
- npm or yarn

### First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd blogster
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in the required values:
     - Supabase URL and anon key (from your Supabase project)
     - Redis URL
     - OpenAI API key
     - Base domain for local development

4. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io)
   - Go to Project Settings > API to get your URL and anon key
   - Execute the SQL migrations from `/supabase/migrations` in the SQL Editor
   - Set up authentication providers as needed (Google OAuth, etc.)

5. **Set up Redis**
   - Use a cloud Redis provider (Upstash, Redis Labs, etc.) or your own hosted instance
   - Add the Redis connection URL to your `.env.local` file
   - No local Redis installation is required

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. **Start the Redis workers (in separate terminal windows)**
   ```bash
   # Blog generation worker
   npm run worker:blog
   
   # Image generation worker
   npm run worker:image
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch for your feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Run tests before committing**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   npm run test:unit
   
   # Run E2E tests
   npm run test:e2e
   
   # Run all tests
   npm test
   ```

3. **Follow the testing workflow**
   - Create specific tests for any new code unit
   - Run the new test in isolation
   - Iterate until the test passes
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Commit and push your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request to the main branch**
   - Ensure all CI checks pass
   - Request a review from at least one team member

### Useful Commands

- **Lint code**
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Format code**
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- **Build for production**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Run production build locally**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Redis connection issues**
  - Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping` should return `PONG`
  - Check your Redis URL in `.env.local`
  - Ensure Redis port (default 6379) is not blocked by firewall

- **Supabase authentication issues**
  - Verify Supabase URL and anon key in `.env.local`
  - Check if your Supabase project has the correct auth settings
  - Ensure email confirmation is disabled for local development

- **Test failures**
  - Run tests with verbose flag: `npm test -- --verbose`
  - Check if environment variables are properly set for testing
  - Verify Redis and Supabase are accessible from test environment
